lc.py is letter cheater. 

The program was conceived based on hours spent playing "letter press", but the results are applicable to any word game where one needs to construct words based on a small set of letters (e.g. scrabble). 

The idea is certainly not original, but this short script should accomplish the desired goal. 

I do not condone the use of this program for cheating, but it should nevertheless be helpful for those who want to cheat in word games.

I'm sure we can dream up other useful purposes for the program. 

Instructions are self-explanatory as the program runs.
