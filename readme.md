lc.py is letter cheater. 

The program was conceived based on hours spent playing "letter press", but the results are applicable to any word game where one needs to construct words based on a small set of letters (e.g. scrabble). 

I don't use this program to cheat, nor support its use for those purposes, but it was fun to think about (and to be honest, it would require a little tweaking to be an effective cheating program).  

Instructions are self-explanatory as the program runs. The dictionary returns all words matching the specified letters. Its current form does not include letter exclusions.
